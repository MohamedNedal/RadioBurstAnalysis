# Solar Radio Burst Analysis 
This repository is dedicated to analyzing data of solar radio bursts obtained from the CALLISTO spectrometer and applying electron density models to calculate the parameters of the coronal shock waves associated with the CME. 

This work is inspired from the IDL code of Pietro Zucca and the Python code of Christian Monstein.
